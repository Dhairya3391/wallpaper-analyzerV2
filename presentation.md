# üé® Wallyzer ‚Äì Project Summary

## Introduction

**Wallpaper Analyzer** is an advanced, AI-powered tool for organizing, analyzing, and optimizing large wallpaper or image collections. It leverages state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning to automate duplicate detection, aesthetic scoring, and image clustering‚Äîall accessible through a modern, real-time web interface.

---

## Key Features

- üß† **Smart Duplicate Detection:** Finds visually similar or duplicate images using perceptual hashing and deep learning (MobileNetV2 features).
- üåü **Aesthetic Scoring:** AI models (ResNet18) rate images for visual appeal, helping you surface your best wallpapers.
- üóÇÔ∏è **Image Clustering:** Groups similar wallpapers using K-means clustering on deep features (ResNet50).
- ‚ö° **High Performance:** Optimized for CPU, CUDA, and Apple Silicon (MPS) for fast, scalable analysis.
- üåê **Real-time Web Interface:** Responsive, beautiful UI with live progress updates via WebSocket.
- üíæ **Result Caching:** Uses SQLite to cache analysis results for instant repeated access.
- üîÑ **Batch & Recursive Processing:** Efficiently processes large collections, including subdirectories.
- üîß **Configurable:** Fine-tune thresholds, batch size, device selection, and more.

## How It Works: Workflow

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[User selects directory] --> B[API: /api/analyze]
  B --> C[AI Analysis: Duplicates, Aesthetics, Clustering]
  C --> D[Results cached in SQLite]
  D --> E[Web UI: Filter, Search, Preview, Manage]
  E --> F[User actions: Re-analyze, Change settings, Download]
```

</div>

1. **User selects a directory** via the web UI.
2. **Backend analyzes images:**
   - Detects duplicates (hashing + deep features)
   - Scores aesthetics (ResNet-based model)
   - Clusters images (K-means on ResNet50 features)
3. **Results are cached** in SQLite for fast repeated access.
4. **Frontend displays results** with filtering, searching, and cluster navigation.
5. **User can re-analyze** with new settings or export results.

## What I Learned

- Building an end-to-end AI application (from model selection to web deployment)
- Optimizing performance for large datasets and heterogeneous hardware
- Creating user-friendly, real-time web interfaces
- Managing and caching results efficiently for a smooth user experience
- Integrating deep learning, clustering, and perceptual hashing in a production workflow

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more image formats and video thumbnails
- Integrate cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- Add user authentication and multi-user support
- Provide export options (CSV, JSON, ZIP)
- Enhance clustering with self-supervised or transformer-based models
- Add more visualization and management tools in the UI
